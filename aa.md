``` **ACCEPTANCE TESTS**

Sure, let's consider an example of a simple e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The stakeholders have provided the following acceptance criteria:

    Users should be able to register an account.
    Users should be able to browse products by category.
    Users should be able to add products to their cart.
    Users should be able to proceed to checkout and complete the purchase.
    Users should receive an email confirmation after completing a purchase.

Now, let's create some acceptance test cases based on these criteria:

    Test Case 1: User Registration
        Test Steps:
            Navigate to the registration page.
            Enter valid user details (name, email, password).
            Click on the "Register" button.
            Verify that the user is successfully registered and redirected to the home page.
        Expected Result: User registration should be successful.
