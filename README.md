## MarineChoice

### PRODUCT VISION

MarineChoice is a phone application that allows users to make conscientious choices about the types of fish they consume on a daily basis by providing them with the information and resources to learn about the harm in non-sustainable fishing and the overconsumption of fish in general. Along with this information, our app also allows the user to learn more about marine life, gives them a surplus of recipes that use susbtainable fish, and share their own.

This project was developed by Cláudia Mesquita (up202206173@fe.up.pt), Pedro Costa (up202206180@fe.up.pt), Luana Lime (up202206845@fe.up.pt), José Santos (up202108673@fe.up.pt), Pedro Lunet (up202207150@fe.up.pt), Team 1 - Class 14, for 'Engenharia de Software' 2023/24.
